B. A small random number used only once to prevent replay attacks

A nonce (from the Latin ""once"") is a small random number used in cryptographic protocols to prevent replay attacks. It is used to ensure that a message or data packet is used only once and cannot be replayed or duplicated. This is an important security feature in many cryptographic protocols, including SSL/TLS, IPsec, and others.","**Scratchpad**: Since the question is asking about the typical use of a 'nonce' in the field of cryptography, I will provide the correct answer.
